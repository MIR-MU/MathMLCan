[MathMLCan][] is a tool which performs canonicalization of mathematical
expressions written in MathML. It is being primary developed to meet the needs
of our mathematical search engine [MIaS][]. However, it is also useful as a
general-purpose tool for MathML encoding normalization.

See the project [wiki][] for more information.
